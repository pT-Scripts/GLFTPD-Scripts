# GLFTPD Scripts by Petabyte

Welcome to the GLFTPD Scripts repository! This collection includes various scripts, addons, modules, and rewrites designed to enhance and extend the functionality of GLFTPD, a powerful FTP server software for Unix-like operating systems. Whether you're looking for bash scripts, Python scripts, TCL addons, or complete module rewrites, you'll find a range of utilities here to optimize and personalize your GLFTPD experience.

## Installation Instructions

### Bash Scripts (.sh files)
1. Place the `.sh` file in `/glftpd/bin`.
2. Run `chmod +x <script_name>.sh` to make the file executable.

### TCL Scripts (.tcl files)
1. Place the `.tcl` file in `eggdrop/scripts`.
2. Load the `.tcl` script in your eggdrop configuration and rehash the bot.

### Usage Tip
The main logic resides in the `.sh` file. Use the `.tcl` script to execute the `.sh` script and announce to IRC. If the script works with `./<script_name>.sh` in the terminal, it will work on IRC/eggdrop.
